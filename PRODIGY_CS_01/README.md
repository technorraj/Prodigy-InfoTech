# Caesar Cipher Program
This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and most well-known encryption techniques. Developed using Python, the program allows users to encrypt or decrypt text by shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

The Caesar Cipher is a form of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This project demonstrates basic cryptography logic in a user-friendly and interactive format, making it ideal for beginners.

This program was created as part of my internship at **The Prodigy Infotech**, with the goal of learning and demonstrating foundational encryption techniques using Python.

## Features

- **Encryption & Decryption**: Supports both encoding and decoding of messages.
- **Custom Shift Value**: Users can define how many positions to shift the letters.
- **Handles Mixed Text**: Letters are encrypted/decrypted, while numbers, punctuation, and spaces remain unchanged.
- **Interactive Input**: The program guides the user with clear prompts.

## How to Use

1. **Run the program** in any Python environment (such as IDLE, terminal, or VS Code).
2. **Select an option**:
   - Type `e` to encrypt a message.
   - Type `d` to decrypt a message.
3. **Enter your message** when prompted.
4. **Provide the shift value** (e.g., `3` to shift letters by 3 positions).
5. **View the output**, which will be either the encrypted or decrypted message.

## Example

- **Input**:  
  Action: `e`  
  Message: `HELLO`  
  Shift: `3`  

- **Output**:  
  `KHOOR`

This same logic works in reverse when decrypting a message.
